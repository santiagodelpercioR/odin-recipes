        <h3>A very healthy AND flavorful burger with a little extra crunch.</h3>
        <p>
            The Argentinian milanesa is also a breaded cutlet shallow-fried in oil. </p> 
            <p>The cutlet typically comes either from the round or from the eye of the round, 
                which are lean cuts, meaning they have less fat, marbling, and sinew when compared to most other cuts of beef. </p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>2 lbs (900g) beef round, thinly sliced (1 cm thick/ 1/2-inch thick)</li>
            <li>2 eggs, beaten</li>
            <li>2 cups (250g) breadcrumbs</li>

            <li>3 tbsp parsley, chopped</li>

            <li>Salt</li>
            <li>Vegetable oil (for frying)</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>

            <li>Slice the beef into 1 cm (1/2-inch) thick cutlets.</li>

            <li>Drench the cutlets in the egg mixture, then let them soak in it in the refrigerator for 45 minutes.</li>
            <li>Heat the oil over medium-high heat until it reaches 170°C/340°F.</li>
            <li>Coat the cutlets in breadcrumbs and fry them on both sides for a few minutes, then place them on paper towels to drain.</li>
            <li>Serve warm, with some of the following: French fries, mashed potatoes, green salad, potato salad, or roasted peppers.</li>
        </ol>
